# Web-based text editor marathon series

This series is designed to be incrementally improved over a time span - thus, the "marathon" in the title. Starting from some very basic functional requirements, further functional/non-functional requirements are added over time to test the implementer's ability to build extensible software & adaptability to changing requirements.

## What you will learn

* Learn to build extensible software.
* Learn to adapt to changing requirements.
* Learn to benchmark & set observability points.
* Learn to identify performance bottleneck.
* Learn to make tradeoffs in software engineering.
