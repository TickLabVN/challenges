# Course Registration System Design
Design and architect a scalable course registration system that can handle peak loads during registration periods

## Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, you will:
- Understand database sharding, caching, and performance optimization strategies
- Practice real-world system scalability and reliability engineering

## Functional Requirements
- User Authentication & Authorization (students, admins)
- Course catalog management (create, update)
- Course registration (with prerequisites validation)
- Waitlist management when courses are full
- Course scheduling and conflict detection
- Reporting and analytics dashboard

## Criterias
1. Domain Modeling: UML Class diagrams
2. Database design: ERD diagrams
3. API Design: OpenAPI Swagger documentation
4. Algorithm Design:
    - Course Availability Management Algorithm (Optimistic Locking)
    - Waitlist Management Algorithm (Priority Queue)
    - ...
5. System Architecture Diagram
6. Monitoring (Grafana, Prometheus)
7. Testing

## Real-World Test Scenarios
**Registration Rush Scenario**

Situation: 10,000 students attempting simultaneous registration at 8 AM

**Expected Behavior:**
- System maintains responsiveness
- Queue management prevents system overload
- Fair course seat allocation without race conditions
- Proper waitlist management with priority ordering
- Zero duplicate registrations
