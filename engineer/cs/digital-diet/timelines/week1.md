## Research
1. Research about how to build a **cross-browser** extension.
2. Can use this template [cross-browser extension template](https://github.com/aklinker1/vite-plugin-web-extension?tab=readme-ov-file).
3. Initialize project structure, push it to github and add mentor to review.

## Implement a simple form
The browser extension should have an intuitive form that allows users to input, view, and manage a list of websites they want to block.
