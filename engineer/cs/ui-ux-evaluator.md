# UI/UX evaluator

## I. Overview
Companies often want their web pages to have the most pleasant experience. Thus, they need some way to quantify this experience & actionable ways to improve it. There have been numerous standards and suggestions to aid in improving the user experience on a website and they are mostly measureable.

Develop a tool that can evaluate the UI/UX quality of a web page based on some standards: Core web vitals, W3C Accessibility Standards and some widely accepted convention for UI/UX.

From this evaluation, the tool suggests a list of UI/UX problems with the web page (may include some references to the standard) and make actionable suggestions.
